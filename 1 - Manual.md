## Our creed

We are a team who passionately believe that Dash and blockchain technology, as a whole, will drive global economic and social change the likes of which have never been seen before. Our unique model enables us to focus the deployment of Dash Network's capital and resources in specific areas to help to develop and grow the Dash and blockchain ecosystem over the long term. Within the next several years, we envision blockchains and digital currencies, like Dash, will grow to have an established, responsibly managed, and regulated role in the global economy, as well as disintermediating a myriad of industries in the process. Our aim is to stimulate such growth in the ecosystem through investment in great ideas/products/solutions that will transform the world we live in.

## Our investor, The DASH DAO Treasury

The [Dash DAO Treasury](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/understanding.html) system is our sole source of funds.

The [Dash DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dash_(cryptocurrency)) is a decentralized autonomous organization. This means that it is a group that functions irrespective of outside control and has no centralized form of decision making. The Dash DAO’s structure allows anyone to participate and make decisions, following a set of rules and structure.

The Dash DAO is governed by Masternodes, stakeholders who have invested 1,000 Dash. In addition to running the coin’s second-tier functions such as InstantSend and PrivateSend, masternodes also vote to fund proposals with Dash’s treasury. Anyone can submit a proposal to the masternodes, and the proposal may be funded if it gets enough Masternode votes.

As a project of the Dash DAO, The Dash Investment Foundation is ultimately responsible to the Dash masternode network. This means our “boss” is everyone who owns some Dash and helps run the network. We have to provide value to the network, and our track record at the Dash Investment Foundation will determine our success in requesting funds for investment purposes in the future. If we do a good job and invest capital wisely, in Founders who grow the Dash ecosystem, then the Network as a whole, including every Dash holder stands to gain. 

## What We Believe About the Future of cryptocurrency

To know how our fund works, it helps to know the views we bring into every meeting, every email we send, every thought about a startup. We've worked to articulate some of these beliefs -- both those writ large about the economy as a whole and the nature of how business will operate in the future. Here are some of our views:

+

## What we look for in a startup

We recognize that spotting the early signs of a world-changing idea/product/solution is hard, and nobody’s cracked how to do it reliably. What we want is a reason to tell ourselves that a startup has a chance to be extraordinary. There are a few areas where we search for signs: certain qualities of a founding team, an early product, areas where we think we can be helpful, and the right moment in a company’s life.  Here is a [complete list](https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md) of the questions we ask ourselves when evaluating startups. 

### Founders

We look for a reason to believe a founding team is extraordinary. Not that they have the perfect skills or experiences to match the business they want to build (which is where the “team” slide in the deck tends to focus), but that they have the capacity for greatness.

What gives us a sense the founders could be extraordinary? Often times, they just have an unusual psychology -- they think they are exceptional, see grand patterns others don’t, are indifferent to norms, and may have an exceptionally high pain threshold. We are inspired by Michael Dearing’s description of the cognitive distortions of founders ([pdf](http://quarry.stanford.edu/xapm1111126lse/docs/02_LSE_Cognitive.pdf), [vid](https://www.harrisonmetal.com/library/the-cognitive-distortions-of-founders)). We have passed on companies because we didn’t think the founders were crazy enough -- they seemed too textbook. (And we don't mean their appearance or background, we mean their level of extraordinary determination, willingness to try, or insight.)

We believe the founders destined for greatness will be magnetic to the best available talent and capital for their companies, and we find ourselves thinking we'd want to work for them (because, if we invest, we will be working for them). They see raising venture capital as a sometimes-necessary aspect of creating a certain kind of business, as opposed to a box to be checked or a badge to be won. They'd continue attacking the problem they've chosen, in some form, whether or not they raise venture capital. They hold as articles of faith that a great company will have a strong culture, and unusual practices that make it an outlier -- and begin to integrate that way of thinking sooner than strictly necessary to continue growing their business. Doing so often means concentrating their teams in one (or at most two) locations, recognizing that the known ceiling for distributed teams is still quite low and that face-to-face conversation is a surprisingly resilient mode.

Great teams have a plan to win when -- surprise, surprise -- they learn that a dozen other teams are pursuing their previously-thought-to-be-unique idea. They persevere when others (including us) tell them that ideas are cheap until they are brought to life. They both see themselves as unique and list many companies as their competitors.

So much of backing founders is about trust -- If we don’t know you ourselves, we prefer if someone we trust knows you. Otherwise we find it hard to trust our impressions of you after a meeting or two; first impressions are so unreliable. That said, we may back founders who we only just met -- sometimes you “just know.”

We also do background checks on founders where we search public records. Almost everyone has something turn up, and that's fine. People get sued, things happen. Some of history's best founders had complicated pasts. The issues arise when we're surprised by something important that we learn -- trust, again -- and we resolve those issues in conversation with founders.

### Inclusion and diversity

We are committed to [making the startup world welcoming](https://www.inclusionintech.com/) to people of all backgrounds -- from our own team, to the founding teams we serve and the companies they build. Startups start with seeing the world anew, and people with different backgrounds see the world differently – so if we want to remake things, we need to enlist people with as wide a range of backgrounds as possible.

We focus our proactive sourcing outreach on seeking out founders from underrepresented communities. We define diversity broadly, including inherent and acquired forms of diversity like gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic class, geography, nationality, education, and others.

We believe groupthink is dangerous in venture capital, and that different perspectives demand different backgrounds. A diverse and inclusive team also just makes for a better experience for us.

We believe progress requires an accumulation of many small decisions over years, and we understand that trust takes time. That said, we commit to act now. Specifically:
+ Our most significant effort to reach new founders is direct from the Dash community, which is about as diverse a community as could be imagined. The Dash community is one of the longest standing in the Cryptocurrency sphere, and it's truly global.
+ As part of our formal criteria for picking investments we want to make, [we only invest in founders we believe are capable of creating a diverse company and an inclusive culture.](https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md#founders-and-team-2) If a startup we back fails to create a diverse and inclusive culture, we would feel regret regardless of how well the company performed financially.
+ All members of the DIF Team are active Dash community members and are usually available on community channels, social media such as  Twitter & LinkedIn, and we endeavour to engage as much as possible and we’ll happily arrange to talk with you by phone or chat if you have anything you wish to discuss with the team.
+ When invited to speak at an industry event, we ask whether there is someone from an underrepresented community speaking alongside us (e.g., on a panel).
+ When we host our own events, we examine our invitation lists for diversity.
+ We are participating in [#MovingForward](https://wearemovingforward.github.io), joining other VC’s to commit to foster a diverse, inclusive, and harassment-free workplace.
+ In future we will update the performance metrics collect on this subject and publish them here (e.g., on the gender composition of our portfolio CEOs) at least annually.

We believe we need to hold ourselves accountable. As one measure, if a founder ever has an issue with our fund or our team, the founder can make a report to the independant Dash DAO Trust board which is an independant entity set up with a fudiciary duty to represent the Dash network's interests in a legal capacity -- they can be contacted at trustprotectors@dash.org. We are accountable to our source of capital, and we will treat any issues raised with the consideration they deserve.

We believe a community of companies is stronger the more different viewpoints come to the table, and intend to actively participate in creating a more inclusive and diverse cryptocurrency industry.

### Product and market

We prefer to see products that are intensely successful in some initial market, over products that grow to large numbers but don’t play an important role in the lives of their users. 

We like products we ourselves would use and understand. We’ve been technology buyers, software developers, founders, entry-level employees, and of course consumers of many media -- so the range of products we might use and understand is broad. These products often start with a specific application of a well-understood technology, not a multi-industry "black box" looking for a use case.

We believe startups destined for greatness, in their earliest days, choose...
+ Only one model for how to sell, generally either directly to an individual or directly to a company (whereas many believe they can do both at first)
+ One type of person (e.g., role within a client company) to target as a customer, and specifically avoid trying to serve business and technical users with the same tool
+ Target customers whose businesses are thriving, and specifically avoid customers in low- or no-growth, or low-margin businesses (e.g., most online publishing)

If a product is launched, we care about how well it is doing -- the famous “traction” -- but we tend not to focus on absolute numbers. We focus on month-over-month (or, in earlier-stage cases, week-over-week) growth, ask questions about how different cohorts of users behave, and try to understand the per-user behavior (how much does any one user really value the product). At the earliest stages, we are most interested in evidence of customer love -- retention or intensity metrics, or even anecdotal praise by customers for the product.

### Stage

We strongly prefer to be the first money into a company, and to invest as early in the startup's life as possible. If a startup incorporates itself to take money from us, that's great. Should you call us if you have yet to even start a company? [YES](https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#beacon).

This isn’t so much a rational investment calculation (arguably there is less competition to write bigger, later checks) -- but it’s a matter of our style. An early investment is less of a transaction and more of a relationship. We do make exceptions for certain reasons (e.g., a founder or company we just couldn’t resist).

“First money in” doesn’t necessarily mean lead investor -- sometimes we are the only investors, sometimes one of many. Sometimes the founder sets the terms, sometimes another investor does, sometimes we do. We are indifferent on this. When we're willing to invest, we're willing to set the terms; whether other investors follow depends.

We are more than happy to invest in companies that might take a very long time to prove they are on to something -- our investor, the Dash DAO, has a decades-long view and is willing to build for the long-term. We do not have a fixed time horizon to expect our companies to return capital. In fact, we prefer companies who are building for permanence.

### Sources

We find investments in many ways, but our favorite is for founders we have already known in the Dash or broader cryptocurrency ecosystem for years, or existing well established community members who refer other founders.

After that, we are most likely to invest in companies that come to us through someone we trust. Several of those have come our way through referrals from the staff at various Dash Funded Organisations -- this creates an instant “customer reference,” often from someone whose judgment we respect.

We don’t really find companies, we mostly find founders. We tend to ask people we trust who are the 1-2 most exceptional people you’ve met, whether in school or at work, or in some other way -- and then we get to know those people. We hope that some of those people evolve to be great founders, and we’d like to know them whether or not they do.

We also try a lot of products. Our phones have many, many apps installed. And we read. We reach out to people and companies whose products we like, or who we read about.

We keep track of companies we’ve been in touch with -- just like we’d hope that our companies do, we have an organized system for our outreach. In general, we try to run our fund with the same tools our companies use.

### “Themes”

Our focus is investing in startups that improve the accessibility of blockchain-based technology for the masses. We believe that cryptocurrency and blockchain applications will be as ubiquitous in the 21st Centuary as the some of the most successful technological developments of the 20th Centuary were. E.g. Television, Nuclear Power, Automobiles, Aircraft, Personal Computers, The Internet.

We have doubts about the effectiveness of theme-based investing. The best founders can surprise an investor with an unexpected take on a category. So we are open to all themes related to blockchain in some way. We are looking for Founders who believe they have created something using blockchain technology which has the potential to solve real world problems, and that customers would benefit hugely from using in their own lives/work/companies. 

### “The Deck”

A demo is 50 times more useful than slides. One is a description of a thing, the other is the thing itself. We look at your demo the way a new user would.

We cringe at the idea of founders spending lots of time making fundraising presentations. When we see “v36” in the filename of a presentation, it bothers us. That said, we do value the work founders do writing down their plans for their company, because it gives us a sense of:
* How the team thinks
* How well the team communicates
* Whether, if we don’t know the team, we should spend the time to meet in person

If you use a presentation to sell your product to customers, we're as interested in that pitch as in your fundraising pitch.

There is no standard format we like, but we probably spend 2-5 minutes reading a deck when we are deciding whether to meet a company. How many slides? Depends, but if you need 20 detailed pages to tell your story, that's likely more than we can absorb.

In day-zero companies, we don't pay much attention to your milestones -- if you are in the discovery phase, trying to figure out what works, you'll generally be unable to predict where you will be beyond two months from now.

We do care about what metrics you intend to track -- what experiments are you running, what hypotheses is your first product testing -- and if there is one metric you care about more than any other.

We also ignore, in most cases, long-term financial projections -- except to the extent that they show what the “unit economics” (revenue and cost from a single user or customer) need to be for the business to work. If you fail to invent assumptions that make the overall business wildly profitable in a few years, then you probably should be doing something else for a living.

That said, we do care about the short-term financial plan, especially on the choices founders directly control. How many people do you intend to hire, where will you spend the money? This helps us figure out how much time you will have before you need more capital, and how far we believe you can get in that amount of time. We prefer to see early-stage companies spending their capital on building product.

Put another way, a five-year financial plan is mostly useless for early stage companies -- a monthly plan for the next twelve months and a quarterly plan for the next two years could be very useful. 

We would love to see all of it, whether perfect or otherwise so give us anything you've already made -- financial model, deck, background materials. It helps us make sure our conversation is more dialogue than exposition.

### In-person meetings

Once we’re meeting in person, usually over video call, you can often leave the laptop closed (unless you're using it for the call!). We’re trying to get a sense of you as a founder, ask you hard questions and see how you respond.

If your product is public, you should assume when we meet that we’ve spent the time to play with it.

Some things we tend to say, ask, or think in meetings:
* We don’t put great faith in the value of advice (including, often, our own) -- the world of users and customers has more to teach a company than any smart, well-intentioned person.
* What makes you an outlier? (Do you know what makes your company a potential outlier?)
* Why is this problem important to you, and how will things be better if you succeed?
* What was the last important skill you learned? (We believe great founders are, paradoxically, both self-confident and exceptionally good learners -- so constantly in need of improvement.) What was the last thing you were wrong about?
* What do you want out of your investors other than money? (We’re trying to figure out if we can be uniquely helpful.)
* If a dozen other companies are creating a company right now with this exact idea, how could you still succeed?
* Who will you pick as your first customers? (This tends to be, in our view, one of the most important early choices founders make.) Who was the last potential customer you spoke with? (Founders who are scared of talking to customers scare us.)
* How close do you feel you are to product-market fit? (Here, it's less that we want you to *have* product-market fit, and more that we want to understand how you think about your own progress wherever you are.)
* Are there any plans you really would like to pursue, but have stopped talking about with investors because you've been told by VCs they are bad ideas? (We often like those plans.)
* If you're successful, what potential harms might your service cause, and what will you do about that? What's been the most difficult ethical dilemma you've had at work?
* For what values would you sacrifice making more money? In practice, have you sacrificed financially to live by a principle?
* How will you build a diverse and inclusive team over the next year? Given your personalities, what culture issues do you think are most likely to arise at your company?
* Why are you raising money at all? (We find there are plenty of startups who don’t actually need to raise money and, in general, that’s better for them -- even if it means we don’t get to participate.)

We try to avoid some of the, shall we say, less useful questions others ask:
* What will you do if [big scary company X] competes with you?
* Have you patented any of this?
* How does this become a $1B business?
* [How’s it going?](http://also.roybahat.com/post/62158854505/a-dumb-question-to-ask-an-entrepreneur)

Founders are sometimes surprised at how quickly our meetings move; we often will take you off your story to zero in on something we believe is a key driver. This is how we’d work with you after our investment, so you can think about whether you enjoy working with us.

At any point, we’d be happy to narrate for you our level of interest -- though you might not always like what you hear. (And remember, an 80% chance of wanting to work together still means there is a 20% chance we will not want to work together.)

Immediately after we meet, a frequent thing we need to do is just think on it -- if we find ourselves getting less excited a day or two later, that’s probably a bad sign. If we find ourselves returning to the conversation in our heads, wondering what you meant when you said such-and-such, and imagining how great the product will be, that’s a great sign.

A lot of founders wonder why investors are slow to get back to them. This is an unacceptable pattern, and yet one we’ve been guilty of from time to time. Sometimes, the reason is we’re doing work on your company (e.g., calling references, who might take a few days to get back themselves). Sometimes it’s that we’re unsure and we’re giving ourselves a few days to see if we get more excited or less as we think on it. Sometimes we just mess up and forget to reply. It’s a fail when that happens. We try to at least narrate as we go with “I know you haven’t heard from us in a few days, this is what’s happening…”

We aspire to be at the extreme end of the “we communicate openly with you” scale.

### “Doing the work” and calling references

If we decide we are going to invest, we often (but not always) go through a short cycle of working on our own view -- probing for holes in our own thinking, asking the advice of our one friend who has been thinking about this industry for 10 years, understanding other approaches that have been tried (or are current competitors), and spending as much time as we can using the product. Many of the same kinds of things we find that founders do in the early days of contemplating creating a new company.

During this period, we try to be open with the founder about whether we will call around to ask about them. We put great faith in the value of these reference calls, and even sometimes check references before meeting a founder for the first time. We owe a debt to the friends, colleagues, and partners who are willing to share open, unvarnished views. We try to skip nonsense questions (“what are their strengths and weaknesses”) and instead focus on things that will help us decide whether to back a founder:
* How does this person compare to other founders you’ve known? Top 10%? 5%? 1%?
* What makes you believe this person is extraordinary?
* If you were us, and decided to invest in the company, in what areas would you guess this person would need the most help?

We call as many references as we can find.

### How we decide

We have a consensus driven policy at the Dash Investment Foundation. Opportunities will be reviewed by the team internally but most of the ground work will usually be completed by just one or two members of the team, likely the ones most passionate about the opportunity. Our best investments might be opposed by one or more of our team, so we operate a majority vote based system with a minimum quorum of 4. This may be relaxed over time as the organisation matures but at this stage of our own development we feel it's a prudent compromise. Our general view though is that teams are great at gathering information and surfacing wisdom, but terrible at making decisions. The bigger the team, the worse the decision! We believe in individual accountability -- if just one or two can say yes, then everyone feels the weight of making a decision. It's something we are aiming for..  (That said, we do require that before anyone says yes they mention the investment to the rest of us -- that way they get the benefit of the team’s input, and it’s a good way to slow down and think for a second.)

We value each others’ opinions and seek them out. Our team is unusual in that we don’t (yet!) have any of the “partner issues” you hear about at other funds. In other funds, it can be the worst of both worlds -- founders lack clarity about how investments get approved, and in some firms the partners become resentful of one another's power to approve each others' investments and then do little to support another partners' companies.

We believe in each others’ talents, trust each other enough not to mind when someone is wildly wrong, and enjoy each others’ views. We talk as a full group twice a week, to think out loud about companies we’ve invested in or might invest in, and we meet for a full few days once every couple of months.

We have posted in public [our criteria for deciding whether to invest]https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/3%20-%20Criteria%20for%20investing.md). When we talk about companies, we use those criteria. 

In practice, here are your odds: we have invested in 0% of the companies we have spent time reviewing, so far. Will you be the first? (metrics to be updated quarterly).

### Our deal memo

Before we invest, we write a brief “note to self” outlining our views. We do this so we can be as disciplined about our commitments as founders are about their commitments. We may also share this note with a small advisory group within the Dash DAO.

In order of importance, we write about:
* The founders’ vision
* Our thoughts on the founding team
* Why we are excited about the company
* If the product is built, what we think of it and how well it is doing
* What we believe the company needs to do to succeed (or make the next major milestone, like a further round of funding)
* The terms of the deal
* Other stuff: competition, market size (to the extent we can tell), use of the funding, business model (in our experience it is usually either unknowable or obvious, and not worth much mental energy either way), what we learned in diligence

### How long it takes

We could make investment decisions in the first meeting (though we would very likely know the founder and something about what they are working on), and we may have cases where we get to know the founder over a period of weeks or months and watch their business evolve (often paying a higher price as we watch the founder make progress!). There is no hard and fast rule about how long it could take.

### Our “Service-Level Agreement”

Some firms commit to giving you an answer in a certain amount of time. We commit that at any point in time, if you ask us to narrate the likelihood of investment and timeframe, we’ll give you our best guess.

The reason we don’t have a guideline like “3 meetings in two weeks” is because that smells like a transaction, and we’d rather be in a long-term relationship with you. We take seriously the process of getting to know a founder and a company, and having the founder truly know and like us.

Many of our investments will evolve out of months or years of conversation with a founder, much of which started before the Dash Investment Foundation even existed. Yes, it's possible for a love at first sight situation -- but it’s exceedingly unlikely. Either way, we’re not sure which will turn out better. But would you tell someone on the first date how many times you had to date them before you decided whether to get married? It’s fundamentally unpredictable at first, but it does become clear quickly.

If you’re in a conversation with us, our policy is “do ask, do tell” -- we are happy to share with you our current sense of excitement and timing. You might have to make a decision, and we want you to know where we stand. If the elevator doors close while we are thinking on it, so be it.

We intend to always give a clear “no” with straightforward reasoning. That reasoning, while straightforward, might still be subjective (“we just didn’t get excited about this and we’re not sure why”).

## The deal terms

We want founders to know what to expect when they work with us before they get to the first meeting, and understanding how we think about deal contracts is an important part of that process. Our legal process is thorough, and we diligently review all documents. 

### How much risk do we take

Since we are looking to bet early, and expect the vast majority of our portfolio companies to fail to return much money, our winners need to be big. We fully expect that, if we succeed, one investment will return our entire fund. So we need to believe that every company could be that investment.

We prefer enormous growth in modest markets to modest growth in enormous markets. We believe that tends to be a more reliable signal of a company's greatness -- it is harder to serve 100 customers exceptionally than to serve 10,000 customers poorly. 

### “Control”

We are not big fans of boards in day-zero companies. While we like founders having a close circle of trusted colleagues to ask for advice and we aspire to be in that trusted circle, when we imagine early-stage founders working on slide decks instead of products, it makes us feel a little ill. We'd rather be in your Slack or getting your Github notifications than having you prepare for meetings.

We also feel that the cadence of board review (every couple of months, let’s say) is mismatched to the cadence of a day-zero company (which evolves every week or two). Later on, boards can be great. If people don’t talk just to hear themselves talk, which each of us has been guilty of now and then.

More generally, we are ambivalent about whether investor control is useful at all. We’ve seen it cut both ways.

So, we generally prefer not to have a seat on a company’s board. But, that said, if the company wants us on the board, we’re open to talking about it -- and we have agreed to join boards from time to time when the founder truly wants this and has good reasons after hearing our views.

### Rights we want

We care about getting pro rata rights. This means that if a founder offers another investor the opportunity to invest at a certain price, we want to invest at that price too -- at least up to the amount needed to preserve our ownership of the company.

We also want to approve of any investments you take that might get their capital repaid before ours.

We care about getting some information rights -- basically the ability for us to understand how well the company is doing, and its financials.

### The numbers

Our standard first check could be anything up to $250,000 for the right opportunity. We want to invest enough to give a startup the money it needs to make real progress in the early days, and to attract other investors alongside us if needed. We are happy to lead, and happy to participate in rounds led by others, depending on the situation.

In many instances we may write smaller checks because we believe in burning capital slowly until you find product-market fit.

We have no minimum check size, and would write checks as $25,000, especially in what we call a ["flag" investment](https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#flag).

We care about price. We avoid having a hard requirement about our ownership percentage. That said, we want to get return on our time in addition to our capital, so we generally want to be able to own a meaningful amount of a company over time. A good rule of thumb for us is that meaningful ownership means roughly 10%. We are comfortable taking the highest possible levels of risk and we believe that founders, and their investors, should be rewarded for that. (We also believe companies are successful when their teams also get generous equity grants that motivate the early team members to create something valuable.)

We also believe “the price is the price” -- we won’t ask for unusual discounts for ourselves with strange terms like participating preferred equity. We are flexible as to whether our investment is structured as convertible debt or as equity. 

No, not every VC wants to own 30% of your company. In fact, we think at seed stages too much ownership by the early investors can ruin the cap table -- making it difficult for the founders to make money, or later investors to own enough of the company when the company needs bigger dollars to scale.

We believe in transparency. If a startup that takes our money wants to publicize the terms of our investment, we’d generally support that. (Of course we’d never disclose anything confidential without consent, and we expect the same of our founders.)

While we’d like to claim that the amount of work we will do on behalf of a company will vary dramatically based on our ownership interest, we’re not sure that is true yet -- the reality is that the amount of work we will do for a company depends most of all on how much the company needs and wants our help. If they ask us to work for them, we do what we can to help.

### Other investors

We don’t care whether we are the lead investor or not. While we prefer to co-invest with others (who can help support a company in difficult times, and bring more expertise to bear), we are happy to invest in situations where we are the only investor. We can also invest in situations where we own such a miniscule percentage of a company that it rounds to zero.

When we do co-invest, we care who a company’s other investors are, because the investors form an extended team around a company -- and we want our companies to have the best teams possible. We get concerned when we see situations with many investors, none of whom have a significant stake, because we worry that none will actually work to help the company.

### Negotiating

We can commit to terms on just a [handshake](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/) as opposed to a formal term sheet (which we're happy to write when founders want them).

We only want founders to hire us as their investor after careful consideration of the alternatives, with as full information as possible. So we're allergic to "exploding offers" (where proposed investment terms expire on a set date) -- in fact we have never made one. Investors and founders enter a marriage from which there is no divorce, so while it's important to choose quickly, it's also a one-way door and it's essential to choose well. 

### Following on

Because we have potentially big funds available to us (compared to the size of our initial checks), we will devote an unusually large proportion of our funds' resources to following on. We will deploy our capital over the usual length of time for a fund: three years or so for all our initial investments, and then follow-on capital after that. One of the benefits of having a single investor (the Dash DAO) with a long term focus is that we avoid setting a specific timetable for expected returns.

We won’t follow on in every investment, but if we are excited about putting in more money, we might want to follow on for 5x our initial investment -- or more. That said, there will also be situations where a company evolves in a way where -- even though it is still a great company -- it would benefit more from another investor’s capital than from ours, so we might not always follow on in great companies.

Much like our initial investments (where we have an "small consensus-driven decision" [policy](https://github.com/DashInvests/manual/blob/master/1%20-%20Manual.md#how-we-decide)), our follow-investments are consensus-driven decisions also. Therefore, we have a much more structured process, where we typically ask founders to present their latest plans to the entire team at the outset.

### “Standard terms”

We believe investors should get a “1x liquidation preference” -- in other words, if the company ends up being worth less than the value that we invested at, we should be able to at least get our money back.

We want to protect your confidentiality and ours, and usually include a standard term to accomplish that -- though the best protection is trust.

## Our “products,” or, how we work with founders

We think of our “products” as offerings of support and capital to a company, and the price we charge is ownership in a company.

### “Seed”
Our preference is to be the first money into a company, and to contribute a meaningful amount of capital. This is the core of what we do, and it will reflect roughly 90% of the dollars we invest. We want to be able to add capital, sometimes even increasing our ownership stake, as the company evolves. While we lack a specific ownership percentage target, we try to get meaningful ownership given the stage of the company -- in practice, this can be 5-15% depending on how far the company’s progressed. (It’s difficult to generalize because, in startups, exceptions are the rule. We also find that hard ownership targets can make it more difficult to form a syndicate with other investors who can be helpful.)

### "Beacon"
We believe that there are exceptional individuals with great ideas who likely have the skills to build a company but lack the network or personal financial means to get started. So we will invest a small amount of capital -- $50K (for roughly 2% of the startup idea you pursue) -- to support very, very early-stage founders explore an idea, validate a key hypothesis, or build an early prototype. Given the low cost of building software today, these small checks are intended to help founders test new ideas cheaply while avoiding excess dilution too early. We also believe that these investments have potential to increase diversity in the founder community. In our experience, the very best founders know how to experiment, iterate, and we are inspired to experiment backing people as soon as we can possibly justify it. [Read more on the why, what we look for, and deal terms here.](https://medium.com/@minnkim/introducing-bloomberg-beta-beacon-52a65e5cba82)

### “Flag”
In some cases, we only seek to put a small amount of money to work (for example, in rounds where the founder is fortunate to have many investors who want to support the company, or it is a later-stage company), and it is unlikely we will invest more. In these cases, our support is as much symbolic as it is financial -- we want to be part of something, even though we know it is unlikely to be an investment that is meaningful to our fund financially. A typical check for these investments might be $50K. While these investments have access to all the services we offer our portfolio, given our lower ownership stake we’re less able to pay proactive attention to these companies and we want to set clear expectations up front about what kinds of startups the founder will likely consider competitive.

## How we support founders

The founders we back are our customers. We aspire to be the most useful investors per minute spent with us, and per dollar on the cap table. We want founders to want to work with us even if we weren't investors offering them money. (Though, for us to be willing to advise, we'd need the same level of conviction that we have when we're willing to invest.)

We want to work with startups the way they work, not the way that big companies or traditional investors work. We prefer to take the formality out of the investor-founder relationship. Instead of requesting board seats and scheduling formulaic calls, we would share with founders and encourage them to reach out to us when we can help. We've can help founders with everything from customer introductions to helping hire a critical new team member to sharing product feedback to engaging Founders with the Dash DAO's own press team. Consider us “on speed dial.” We try to cut waste out of the process; starting a company is hard enough. If you want regular check-ins, sure.

Our team works closely together -- we speak often and love helping each other, and we will each know the full portfolio -- so every portfolio company has access to every member of our team. We think this is different to some other venture firms we’ve met -- we try to be a “no dysfunction” partner to you.

### Areas where we tend to be most useful

While we’re happy to help companies across the full range of early-stage company questions -- recruiting (how to seal the deal for a critical early hire?), fundraising (should I take more money or call it a day?), services (who do I use for HR?) -- we concentrate on the range of skills loosely called “going to market.” Our focus on the future of work means that we may know your market well, or your business model.

To us, going to market includes finding product-market fit, segmenting your market, sequencing your approaches to potential users or customers, pricing, understanding when to review and when to ignore the competition, using the various organic marketing tools, paid marketing, press, partnerships, planning to raise more capital, and just the overall understanding of the importance of communicating who you are and why you are. We have many views here that startups find surprising.

We bridge multiple professional worlds -- technical, financial, corporate, philanthropic, political, social, and otherwise. We try to bring founders across those bridges early and often, with introductions to leaders in any of those fields and group discussions to share ideas and lessons learned that are applicable to startups.

We don’t care about face time -- you won’t get a “hey let’s have coffee and a video call just to catch up” every two weeks. We do spring into action when we see the Bat Signal. We take feedback from companies on what they want. Some of our companies may want us to do monthly, or even weekly, meetings with them, others may “go into hiding” while working on their product -- we’re good either way.

Because we sometimes create our own products, we stay current on tactical trends and may know them firsthand. If you're building something that we can use on our team, we'll share product feedback and be your biggest advocate. We believe founders have as much wisdom as investors (or more) -- we’re all just trying to spark something great in this big wide world.

One thing many founders don’t realize is how little direct control their investors ultimately have -- we can’t demand certain information from you unless it’s specifically written into our agreements (where we often ask only for general financial information), we won’t be able to make you hire or fire anyone -- we work with you based on mutual trust.

### How we like to communicate with you

It varies. In some cases most of our communication is by email and chat, others where we do a regularly-scheduled call, others where we meet in person from time to time -- it just depends on what the founder wants. At minimum, we generally like to know the number one thing we can help a company with at a given time so we can focus on that.

We appreciate getting regular investment updates (e.g., a monthly email) from companies we back, since it creates a background of good understanding that helps us help you.

What makes a good written update for investors?
* A summary (sentence!) that helps us understand how you're doing at trying to accomplish the most important thing for your startup right now -- usually we think in terms of the risks you're trying to address
* Usually, that means the one operational metric you believe tells the story of where you are, and how that metric changed since last time you communicated it (and relative to your expectations)
* What you’re most excited about now
* How you’re doing financially (cash left, burn)
* Team additions or changes
* Where you want help from us!

Here is a [sample anonymized update](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xykbjs0KnhdA2qYdvY_jm21QJdS35iETouNNe2nARJA/edit).

Even better than an update intended for investors is a passive way to keep us updated (i.e., something that requires no incremental work). If you send a weekly internal update, copying us is great; if you use a team collaboration tool (Slack, Trello, Telegram, a Skype chat, etc.) we’d love to be included and take it as a great sign of trust; we even subscribe to private Github repos.

### How to make the most of us

What gets us going is helping companies realize their potential. We are happiest when we are “in it” with you, introducing you to customers, helping close candidates, whiteboarding a set of features, pushing back on your plan to announce your fancy new product release, or getting that late night call that you think things aren’t working out with the person you just spent six months to recruit. We feed off your enthusiasm, and hope to help you build even more of it.

We intend to earn the trust all the founders we wprk with. We commit to being available to you whenever you want to talk. We try to notice when it’s "a moment," and especially important to lead with empathy. We recognize that issues around the personal finances of founders are particularly important and often go undiscussed -- We commit to treating founders' personal financial information, when they share it with us, with confidentiality and respect. We intend to use our knowledge to help you and your companies.

We also know startups are not all roses and sunshine, even for the best of companies. We aspire to be most helpful to you when times are tough.

Investing, to us, is really nothing more than the mechanism we use to find a way to work with you. We are more comfortable talking about new product launches than about how to optimize our allocation of capital across our portfolio.

### Each other

The Dash Investment Foundation is just one Dash Funded Organisation that is part of a fast growing group of organisations under the Dash DAO umbrella, all of these organisations and companies can be helpful to each other should they want to be -- vendor referrals, emotional support, product tips, etc.

It is our plan to set up a community channel on Slack, so that our Founders can reach out and tap into the greater Dash DAO family, as well as other Founders who have received investment from the Dash Investment Foundation. Our founders can congratulate each other, promote one another's successes, support each other through tough spots, offer tactical recommendations ("who should I use as an accountant?") in ways much more immediate, varied, and specific than our fund could do for any of them directly.

We have seen over the years how communities have build the Dash Network and want to continue to support these kinds of communities, that openly share a craft to hone the trade of company and organisation building, with a particular set of companies that share a similar way of working and similar values. This kind of community will itself be part of the future (and the past) of work done well.

### Learning

We recognize that founders don’t have the time to plan for their own professional growth and learning, so we offer them some of that. We might do a training on how to create useful communication with technical teams, or invite founders to a panel on a subject we think they might care about. Founders can request information on Talks on topics of particular interest to them, of course.

### After the exit...

We are disciplined about learning from every company. We will write up a retrospective report where we evaluate our value added to the team -- vs. what we wish we could have added. We assess whether we were right on the risks the company faced, and what lessons we learned. Most important, we ask whether the founder would have asked for our money again.

Capital that we earn will be used to reinvest further in the growth of the Dash DAO & Network, by making similarly successful investments. If that capital cannot be deployed for a meaningful return in value then the Dash Investment Foundation is mandated to use excess capital to buy Dash currency from the open markets and destroy them, in much the same way as a share buyback would take place in a traditional company.

### Company feedback on us

Once a year we will ask all our founders to do a short anonymous survey to give us feedback on what we can do better. Always be learning from your customers -- ours are founders.

## Finding us

If you don’t know how to find us, figure it out. Great founders overcome much more than that. If you can't, you don’t know how to use the internet and you should probably rethink whether being a founder is the right career for you.

### How to reach out

Should you send us a cold email? Probably not. If we were a customer of yours, would you email us cold? Wouldn’t you rather try to find someone in common? If you have to resort to a cold email, which great people sometimes do, at least show us that you took the time to exhaust the available sources of information first. Write an interesting headline. Tell us you read this…sentence…right…here.

### Caveats founders should know

Things that won't work:
* A first email that says “My round is closing next week. Do you have interest?” We understand that founders are eager to close their funding rounds. Sometimes timing doesn’t work -- we have no fear of the elevator doors closing on us. That said, we always try to imagine how we'd behave with any company if there *were* enormous time pressure to decide (founder time is precious) -- and behave that way regardless.
* “You can only try our product if you invest.” If the product isn’t ready, we understand that. But if it is ready and we can’t play with it, we can't figure out whether to work with you.

We will turn down investing in a startup that is a known competitor today to one of our portfolio companies. If you pitch us, and we think one of our founders might find it competitive, or you might find one of our investments (especially an un-announced one) competitive, we'll tell you that we think there is a risk and (in as much as we can share) why. Then, if you want to continue talking, we'll agree with you on what we can share with the other founder (and then, vice versa) to assess the risk of a competitive issue as openly as possible. 

We recognize that competition issues can be complicated. Our intent is to respect the interests of our portfolio companies, and the confidentiality of every startup with which we communicate.

### Why you should take our money

We wrote this manual so you could understand how we work, and see if you want our money. We hope this manual achieved that, and that we can avoid repeating it all right here.

### Thank you

We all move fast, and prefer to spend our time on things that matter. So if you read this, and if you spend time with us, we hope that -- whether or not we work together -- you find it worth it.
