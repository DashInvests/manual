The Dash Investment Foundation's Current Portfolio
========

Going forwards the Dash Investment Foundation's portfolio will consist of two main elements:

- Investment Reserves provided by the Dash Treasury system, in order for us to invest in promising ideas/products/solutions that will drive adoption of cryptocurrency and help grow the Dash Ecosystem. Our strategy is to hold these reserves in a balanced portfolio consisting of Dash, Gold, and stablecoins/USD/EUR/CHF.
- Private Equity Investments that we have made on behalf of the Dash Network.
