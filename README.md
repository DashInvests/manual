### Why We Exist
The Dash Investment Foundation (DIF) was incorporated on March 21st 2019 as a Cayman Islands foundation company limited by guarantee. We believe it's the world’s first ownerless and memberless investment fund. The DIF is tasked with strengthening the Dash network through investment operations funded by the network itself.

Dash is now the first cryptocurrency network with a [proposal system](https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/governance/using.html) capable of investing in its own ecosystem, and no longer must all distributions from the this system be grants. The DIF acts as a bridge between the network protocol and legacy financial/legal systems, opening new possibilities of partnership between entrepreneurs and the Dash network. Importantly, this capability has arrived in time to benefit developers looking to build applications on the Dash Platform ("Evolution").

### How does the Dash network maintain control of this company?

Dash [masternode operators](https://www.dash.org/masternodes/) hold annual elections for six supervisors to oversee the DIF. Key organizational and operational decisions of the DIF are put to these supervisors for approval by the DIF's managers/directors. The supervisors may consist of virtually anyone trusted by the Dash network to carry out supervisory duties, while the managers/directors consist of experts with the appropriate skills to oversee the DIF. Day-to-day operations reside with the DIF's managers/directors.

### Why Our Website is on GitHub

In treating our stakeholders and partners as customers, we often think about how to build as much trust as possible with them. We believe transparency — in how we think, what we believe, and why — is the first step to that trust.

When we were writing an [operating manual] for ourselves, we realised that much of this information might be useful for all stakeholders in Dash, especially founders/owners of startups in the crypto ecosystem looking for investment. We hope that once everything is open source, it will save us all time to have these facts out in the open. And ideally, it'll help startups and company owners decide whether to work with us.

We are in the process of moving our entire web presence to GitHub to become even more transparent. Here, you can see how things have changed over time, propose improvements, or even take our ideas and make them your own. You can also see the things you'd usually find on a venture investor's website, like [a list of our founders] and [the questions we ask ourselves when evaluating startups].
